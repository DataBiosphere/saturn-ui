# test-utils

Shared configuration for testing packages with Jest.

Note that, unlike most packages, this package does not have a build process.
Because the source files are directly exported, ES Modules are named with a
`.mjs` extension to enforce fully specified imports within this package.

The files in src/transforms were originally generated by Create React App.
Since they are CommonJS, they are named with a `.cjs` extension.
