## Design System Overview

The UX team is developing a design system in Figma to help us create a consistent and cohesive user experience across Terra. Although it is still in active development, a prototype can be seen at the following link:

[Terra Design System](https://www.figma.com/proto/fGlf8DGgTz5ec7phmzNUEN/Terra-Styles-%26-Components?page[â€¦]caling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=869%3A14308&mode=design)

## Storybook Information

We are starting to build out stories for our reusable components in terra-ui. This includes both small easily consumable components
that are in the `packages` directory structure (published to npm for use in other repositories), and larger components
that currently live within the `src` directory structure, but may be moved into the published packages in the future.
Stories include documentation of the component properties, and where possible they are interactive.

When viewing the stories within [Chromatic](http://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=65fc89c9335768720ff8605a&branch=dev), there is also a `Designs` tab that links to the corresponding part of the design system in Figma ([example](https://www.chromatic.com/component?appId=65fc89c9335768720ff8605a&csfId=packages-components-buttonsecondary&buildNumber=96&k=663d4043550f2cf95263900f-1200px-designs-true&h=50&b=-3)).
