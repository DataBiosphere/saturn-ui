/*
  Note: In the following circumstance, this will not show DE even though DE
  could be shown: User logged into multiple Google accounts. One of the accounts
  that's not the current Terra user can see DE.
  We show notInAuthDomain instead of DE in this case because otherwise, user
  won't be able to save to Terra because the current Terra user won't be in
  right auth domain.
  To test "User has not completed oauth for this Data Explorer":
    1. Revoke DE at https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
    2. Clear browser cache
    3. Go to de.appspot.com/_gcp_iap/clear_login_cookie to delete IAP login cookie
  To test "User has completed oauth but has not used DE from this browser:
    2 and 3 from above.
  To test "Used DE from this browser but IAP login cookie has expired":
    No easy way to test, just have to wait for cookie to expire
